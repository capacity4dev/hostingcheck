Hostingcheck is a standalone project to validator the hosting requirements without
the need to install your actual project first.


# Goals

* Validate the hosting environment by creating a test scenario (no programming 
  skills required).
* Validate environments on platforms you don't have access to (internally) by
  running the scenario and download the report(s).
* Collect information about the hosting.
